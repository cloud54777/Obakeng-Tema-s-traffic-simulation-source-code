# Combined Scoring Method - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The traffic light control system has been updated to use a **combined scoring method** that balances **efficiency** (keeping green lights when traffic is flowing) with **fairness** (preventing cars from waiting too long).

---

## What Changed

### 1. **Removed Priority Scores System** ❌
- **Old**: Had 3 separate scoring systems (priority, green, red)
- **New**: Only 2 scoring systems (green and red) with clearer purposes
- **Why**: Priority scores were redundant and only used once at startup

### 2. **New Scoring Formulas** 📊

#### **Green Score (Efficiency Check)**
```
greenScore = carsPassed_green + carsApproaching_green
```
- **carsPassed_green**: Vehicles that have passed through during current green phase
- **carsApproaching_green**: Vehicles in detection zone heading toward green light

**Purpose**: Measures how well the current green light is being utilized.

#### **Red Score (Fairness & Urgency)**
```
redScore = (carsWaiting × firstWait_s) + carsApproaching_red
```
- **carsWaiting**: Vehicles stopped at the red light
- **firstWait_s**: How long the first (front) car has been waiting (in seconds)
- **carsApproaching_red**: Vehicles in detection zone heading toward red light

**Purpose**: Measures how urgent it is to switch to the waiting traffic.

### 3. **Improved Decision Rules** 🚦

#### Normal Switching
```
IF redScore > greenScore × 1.5
THEN switch to yellow → red → give other direction green
```

#### Fast-Track Switching
```
IF greenScore ≈ 0 AND redScore > 0
THEN switch immediately
```
**Why**: If green flow has stopped and red has demand, don't waste time.

#### Safety Cap
```
IF green phase duration > 100 seconds
THEN force switch
```
**Why**: Prevents one direction from monopolizing the intersection.

## Files Modified

### 1. **sensors.js**
Added tracking for:
- ✅ `carsApproaching` - Cars in detection zone but not stopped
- ✅ `carsPassed` - Cars that passed during current green phase
- ✅ Reset logic when lights turn green

### 2. **trafficLights.js**
Changes:
- ✅ Removed `priorityScores` variable
- ✅ Added `greenPairApproaching` and `redPairApproaching` tracking
- ✅ Added `maxGreenDuration` (100s) and `switchThreshold` (1.5)
- ✅ Rewrote `calculateCurrentGreenPairScore()` to use new formula
- ✅ Rewrote `calculateWaitingRedPairScore()` to use new formula
- ✅ Rewrote `getFirstDetectedPair()` to use combined scores
- ✅ Removed obsolete `calculatePairScore()` function
- ✅ Added comprehensive documentation header
- ✅ Enhanced logging for score comparisons

## Examples

### Example 1: Small wait, green flowing
**Snapshot:**
- Green: carsPassed=12, carsApproaching=2
- Red: carsWaiting=3, firstWait=2s, carsApproaching=1

**Calculation:**
```
greenScore = 12 + 2 = 14
redScore = (3 × 2) + 1 = 7
Threshold = 14 × 1.5 = 21
Decision: 7 > 21? NO → Keep green ✅
```

### Example 2: Moderate wait, demand building
**Snapshot:**
- Green: carsPassed=18, carsApproaching=1
- Red: carsWaiting=4, firstWait=8s, carsApproaching=2

**Calculation:**
```
greenScore = 18 + 1 = 19
redScore = (4 × 8) + 2 = 34
Threshold = 19 × 1.5 = 28.5
Decision: 34 > 28.5? YES → Switch 🔄
```

### Example 3: Green idle, red has cars
**Snapshot:**
- Green: carsPassed=0, carsApproaching=0
- Red: carsWaiting=2, firstWait=4s, carsApproaching=6

**Calculation:**
```
greenScore = 0 + 0 = 0
redScore = (2 × 4) + 6 = 14
Fast-track: greenScore ≈ 0 AND redScore > 0? YES → Switch immediately ⚡
```

## Benefits

### ✅ **More Efficient**
- No wasted calculations (removed redundant priority scores)
- Fast-track rule prevents idle greens
- Anticipates platoons with `carsApproaching`

### ✅ **More Fair**
- Front-car wait time ensures no car waits forever
- Linear relationship: wait 2× longer = 2× more priority
- Max green cap prevents monopolization

### ✅ **More Responsive**
- Detects approaching cars before they queue
- Adapts to real-time traffic patterns
- Clear, interpretable formulas

### ✅ **More Maintainable**
- Single scoring mechanism (no confusing 3-system setup)
- Clear documentation
- Better logging for debugging

## Testing the Changes

1. **Start the simulation** in Adaptive Mode
2. **Watch the console logs** - you'll see:
   ```
   🟢 GREEN SCORE (NS): Passed=15, Approaching=3, Total=18.0
   🔴 RED SCORE (WE): Waiting=4, WaitTime=8.2s, Approaching=2, Total=34.8
   📊 SCORE CHECK: Green=18.0, Red=34.8, Threshold=27.0, FastTrack=false
   ```
3. **Observe behavior**:
   - Lights stay green when traffic is flowing
   - Lights switch when red wait time builds up
   - Fast switching when green goes idle

---

## Configuration

You can adjust these parameters in the code:

```javascript
this.adaptiveState.switchThreshold = 1.5;      // Higher = more stable
this.adaptiveState.maxGreenDuration = 100000;  // 100 seconds max
```

**Threshold recommendations:**
- `1.2` - Very responsive (may flicker)
- `1.5` - Balanced (recommended)
- `2.0` - Very stable (longer waits)

---

## Summary

The new combined scoring method is:
- **Simpler** (2 systems instead of 3)
- **Smarter** (anticipates demand, prevents waste)
- **Fairer** (wait time matters, max green cap)
- **Clearer** (easy to understand formulas)

It combines the best of efficiency-based and fairness-based control strategies into one unified system! 🚦✨

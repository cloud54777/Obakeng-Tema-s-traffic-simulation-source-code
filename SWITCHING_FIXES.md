# Traffic Light Switching Issues - FIXED ✅

## Problems Identified

### 1. **West-East lights staying on forever (no switching)** 🚨
**Root Cause:** Fast-track switching logic was too aggressive

**Old Logic:**
```javascript
const greenFlowStopped = currentScore === 0 || getCurrentGreenCarsPassed() === 0;
const fastTrackSwitch = greenFlowStopped && waitingScore > 0;
```

**Problem:** This would trigger immediately even when:
- Cars were approaching but hadn't passed yet (score = 0 initially)
- Green just started (no cars passed yet)
- Result: Constant switching, or green never getting a chance to work

### 2. **Timer starting for every car instead of just front car**
**Issue:** Needed clearer logging to show which car's timer is being used

## Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Improved Fast-Track Logic ✅

**New Logic:**
```javascript
// ONLY trigger if green is TRULY idle
const greenTrulyIdle = currentScore === 0 && phaseTimer > 3000;
const fastTrackSwitch = greenTrulyIdle && waitingScore > 5;
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Requires green to be idle for **at least 3 seconds** before fast-track
- ✅ Requires **meaningful demand** (score > 5) on red side
- ✅ Prevents premature switching when green just started

**Result:** Green gets a proper chance to work before switching!

### Fix #2: Enhanced Logging ✅

**Added detailed console output:**
```
📊 SCORE CHECK: 
  Green=15.0, 
  Red=8.5, 
  Threshold=22.5, 
  GreenIdle=false, 
  FastTrack=false, 
  MaxGreen=false, 
  ThresholdExceeded=false, 
  PhaseTimer=4.2s

🔄 SWITCHING! Reason: THRESHOLD EXCEEDED
```

**Front Car Tracking:**
```
⏰ FRONT CAR DETECTED: Car 42 from north - This car's timer will be used!
🚗 Additional waiting car: Car 43 from north (Front car: 42)
⏱️  FRONT CAR WAIT TIME: NORTH - Car 42 has waited 5.2s
```

### Fix #3: Better Red Score Logging ✅

**Shows individual direction scores:**
```
🔴 RED SCORE (NS): 
  Waiting=3/2 (north/south), 
  WaitTime=8.5s/6.2s, 
  Approaching=1/2, 
  Total=52.5
```

---

## Decision Rules (Updated)

### Normal Switching
```
IF redScore > greenScore × 1.5
THEN switch
```

### Fast-Track Switching (Now Fixed!)
```
IF green_idle_for_3s AND redScore > 5
THEN switch immediately
```

**Example:**
- Green has been idle (no cars) for 3+ seconds
- Red has 5+ waiting/approaching
- → Switch immediately (don't waste time)

### Max Green Safety
```
IF green_duration > 100 seconds
THEN force switch
```

## Testing

### What to Watch For:

1. **Normal Operation:**
   ```
   🟢 West-East gets green
   🚗 Cars pass through
   📊 Green score increases
   ⏰ North-South cars start waiting
   🔴 Red score builds up
   📊 Red score > Green score × 1.5
   🔄 SWITCHING! → Yellow → Red → North-South gets green
   ```

2. **Fast-Track (Idle Green):**
   ```
   🟢 West-East has green
   ⏱️  3 seconds pass, no cars
   🚗 North-South has 3 waiting cars
   📊 Green=0, Red=5+
   🔄 SWITCHING! Reason: FAST-TRACK (Green Idle)
   ```

3. **Front Car Timer:**
   ```
   🚗 Car 10 approaches red light (North)
   🛑 Car 10 stops
   ⏰ FRONT CAR DETECTED: Car 10 from north
   🚗 Car 11 stops
   🚗 Additional waiting car: Car 11 from north (Front car: 10)
   ⏱️  FRONT CAR WAIT TIME: NORTH - Car 10 has waited 5.0s
   ```

## Summary of Changes

### trafficLights.js
```diff
- const greenFlowStopped = currentScore === 0 || getCurrentGreenCarsPassed() === 0;
- const fastTrackSwitch = greenFlowStopped && waitingScore > 0;
+ const greenTrulyIdle = currentScore === 0 && phaseTimer > 3000;
+ const fastTrackSwitch = greenTrulyIdle && waitingScore > 5;

+ Added: PhaseTimer logging
+ Added: Switch reason logging
+ Added: Individual direction red scores
```

### sensors.js
```diff
+ if (!this.waitingCars[direction]) {
+   // FRONT car detected
+ } else {
+   // Additional car (not front)
+ }

+ Enhanced: Front car detection logging
+ Enhanced: Wait time logging
```

## Expected Behavior Now

✅ **Lights will switch properly**
- Green gets adequate time to work
- Switch happens when red demand exceeds green performance
- Fast-track only when green truly idle

✅ **Front car timer works correctly**
- Only first car's timer is tracked
- Other waiting cars are counted but timer ignored
- Clear console logs show which car's timer is used

✅ **No more "stuck" lights**
- Max green cap ensures switch after 100s
- Fast-track prevents wasting time on idle greens
- Normal threshold ensures fair switching

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Open browser console (F12)
2. ✅ Start simulation in Adaptive Mode
3. ✅ Watch for switching behavior
4. ✅ Verify green stays for reasonable time
5. ✅ Verify switches happen when red demand high
6. ✅ Check front car logging

The system should now work properly! 🚦✨
